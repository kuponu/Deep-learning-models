# Deep-learning-models for optical character recognition

A look at some of the models used in deep learning. This includes Multiclass Logistics Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
These models were used to recognize optical characters. 

One would see that as you move along the models (from LR to CNN), the model performance begins to improve.
